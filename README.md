# Design Implementations and Rationale

* I used the same fonts and same colours as the original Wordle , for a sense of familiarity while playing my version.

* I've gone for a pop up screen at the start that isn't too big nor small,so that users from any device can be comfortable seieng it, and therefor closing it.

* I've included my To-Do-List and my Done-list , to show my progress throughout this project, and to areas in which I know i can, and if given time in the future can improve in newer updates.
